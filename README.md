1 - Go to this script to prepare data 
combinationMultiTargetMultiPosibleLeftWithProgress.R
2 - Edit the Right field, the left field and the targets fields as you like
3 - Run it (If there is a lot of targets i can takes a lot of time)
4 - It will generate csv file in c:\qpadmdata\( you can change the path if you want but do it on both ends)
5 - When the data are ready go to this file
generatePlotFromCsvLargeData.R
6- Run it, it will use the csv files generated in c:\qpadmdata\ to generate plots in c:\qpadmgraphics

The other files are just different attempts to do the same thing
